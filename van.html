			<h3>Reading Assignment No. 1</h3>
			<h2>Vannevar Bush Essay</h2>
			<h3>by Harry Guigui</h3>
		</div>

		<div id="write-up">

	<p>
		The thing that really caught my eye in this piece was Vannevar Bush’s essay was his claim that the advancement of photography won’t stop. Science and innovation is driven by the needs of society.
	</p>
	<p>
		We currently have:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li> Resolutions that can match the “resolution” of the human eye. </li>
	<li> A high-end Phantom camera captures about a million frames per second, which is complete overkill unless you want to watch a single human blink, which lasts over 11 hours. </li>
	<li> An even higher and truly remarkable trillion frames per second, MIT project, which is used to capture images of light moving. </li>
	<li> Dynamic range that beats a human’s ability (due to the effort it takes to look at super bright or dark objects) </li>
	<li> High end night vision </li>
	<li> And so much more </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		In general we have more technology than we know what to do with. We have more technology than we currently know what to do with. It is on par with what we can perceive. If the resolution is better than we can perceive then how would we know? If we can make out sufficient detail with night-vision to accomplish all our military and information gathering needs, why bother perfecting them to the point where we can read size 8 point font in total darkness. And if we do where do we go from there.
	</p>
	<p>
		The point is, as humans we are incredibly limited by what we already know and what we can dream up. Technology will improve but after a certain point it will only be about making it cheaper, sexier, and in a smaller package. Photography Technology will stop advancing at some point. It may be very soon.
