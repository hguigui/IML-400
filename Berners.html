			<h3>Reading Assignment No. 3</h3>
			<h2>The world-wide web Essay</h2>
			<h3>by Harry Guigui</h3>

	<p>
		It was really interesting reading about the internet from an older perspective. What seems incredibly basic to us had to be laid out in extensive writing. The article is also written in an incredibly counter intuitive way"
	</p>
	<p>
		For one, the essay assumes that we won't be able to access the internet ourselves so it lays out exactly what the web looks like. Yet, within the next few pages it delves far deeper into the description of the internet. This kind of knowledge would only be necessary if you were an expert on the internet, studying the internet or really bored and needed reading material. Anyone who wants to enquire further about the workings of the internet, as laid out by the article, would have experienced it first hand already.

	<p>
		It was also great seeing the images of the old internet/programs as well as the old hardware. The nostalgia of it all is both funny and oddly saddening.
