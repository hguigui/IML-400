<!-- I elected to take a simple approuch to this homepage. It is easy to read, and navigate. It isn't particularly elegant in a big way and that is intentional. I prefer a slightly jankier look. It is more me. My work does what it needs to do.-->
<!-- On occasion I will go more elegant in deisgn but that is primarily when I wish to build a site that will be representitive of a larger work, i.e. my documentary webpage. For this page however I went with a simple box.-->
<!-- The background I used is a graphic I found online. It represents two concepts/subjects that I heartily enjoy. 1) Space: The vast infinity and countless oppurtunities for discovery, exploration, life and creativity it provides. -->
<!-- 2) Mimimalism and the countless layers of that concept. The ability to layer your own meaning onto images, the hunt for a meaning or discovery of concepts. Often times, comedy in sitcoms derive from "oh yeah" or "that's just like real life" moments -->
<!-- Similarly, Minimalism can work on that concept too. And I dig that. The Courier font I used is meant to in part reflect my screenwriting side, in part to ironically reference fitting into a role that society assigns for you and finally to make a mockery of making essays longer -->
