						There is a distinct difficulty when it comes to discussing dragons because of the sheer volume of references to them in literature. There are books that mention them briefly, books that have dragons as Primary, Secondary and Tertiary characters, and there are books written on the sole subject of Dragons totalling upwards of 1,000 different types or "breeds" of dragon.	
					</p>
					<p>
					</p>
					<p>
						There are several things that almost every dragon has in common though.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Dragons can fly, they have large leathery, bat-like wings.
						</li>
						<li>
							They can breath fire.
						</li>
						<li>
							They like or are attracted to gems.
						</li>
						<li>
							They are omnivores.
						</li>
						<li>
							They possess some form of magical powers.
						</li>
						<li>
							They hatch from a small clutch of eggs.
						</li>
						<li>
							Their scales cover their bodies in a tough armor everywhere except for their bellies and their wings.
						</li>
						<li>
							Dragons won't die of old age
						</li>
						<li>
							Dragons never stop growing, but their growth does slow down
						</li>
