			<h3>Reading Assignment No. 2</h3>
			<h2>Joi Ito Essay</h2>

	<p>
		This essay made very little sense. Or rather, the essay says thing and then contradicts them. In the end, it's a whole lot of nothing other than saying, "here is something about the internet, although it's also not true. "both complete order and complete chaos offer very little information, value or energy. Systems that help order chaos or disorder order are useful."

	<p>
		The article makes good points about the rapid nature of the internet's growth. In an increasingly media driven society, any viral video that has an upload date that occurred over two weeks ago is considered old and irrelevant. Movies that came out over a decade ago are considered quite old. I think that that is the funniest, yet most incredible and oddly humbling, thing.
